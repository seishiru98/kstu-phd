	abstract = {Methane is the main component of natural gas but not the only one. In fact in natural gas are usually present also higher alkanes (ethane, propane, butane, and pentanes), water, nitrogen carbon dioxide and sulphur containing molecules. Within sulphur containing molecules the most abundant is hydrogen sulphide, but mercaptans, elemental sulphur and, less frequently, carbonyl sulphide may also be present. The treatment of natural gas in order to remove sulphur containing compounds is dependent not only on the quantity of these compounds but also on the volume of natural gas to be treated. In this review, will be illustrated the main industrial processes to remove H2S, in large (more than 20tonsulphur/day), intermediate (20kgsulphur/day{\textless}quantity {\textless}20tonsulphur/day) and small amounts (lower than 20kgsulphur/day). Mercaptans removal methods according to their molecular weight and content will be discussed.},

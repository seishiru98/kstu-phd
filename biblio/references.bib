abstract = {Methane is the main component of natural gas but not the only one. In fact in natural gas are usually present also higher alkanes (ethane, propane, butane, and pentanes), water, nitrogen carbon dioxide and sulphur containing molecules. Within sulphur containing molecules the most abundant is hydrogen sulphide, but mercaptans, elemental sulphur and, less frequently, carbonyl sulphide may also be present. The treatment of natural gas in order to remove sulphur containing compounds is dependent not only on the quantity of these compounds but also on the volume of natural gas to be treated. In this review, will be illustrated the main industrial processes to remove H2S, in large (more than 20tonsulphur/day), intermediate (20kgsulphur/day{\textless}quantity {\textless}20tonsulphur/day) and small amounts (lower than 20kgsulphur/day). Mercaptans removal methods according to their molecular weight and content will be discussed.},

shorttitle = {Natural Gas Sweetening by using Iron Sponge Process},
abstract = {Natural gas is considered the most important and popular fuels in the current era and future as well. Moreover, the demand of natural gas in recent decade has been dramatic. However, because the natural gas is existed in deep underground reservoirs so it may contain several non-hydrocarbon components for example, hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide. Moreover, these impurities are undesirable compounds and cause several technical problems for example, corrosion and environment pollution. In fact, there are several methods and processes for gas sweetening for example, chemical absorption, solid bed method and physical absorption. Indeed, Hamilton North Field is located in the East Irish Sea-{UK} (Gluyas and Hichens, 2003). According to raw natural gas stream compositions, the Hamilton North gas field is contained small amount of Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) gas about 30 ppm. Moreover, this H2S amount may consider small and it could be treated by adopting iron sponge process. Thus, this study aims to design iron sponge process for Hamilton north field. Moreover, design calculations covered several process design points for example, vessel diameter which it calculated (76 cm) and gas cycle time (30 days).Furthermore, the iron sponge cost is also calculated in this study.},

Criterion for flooding which was found to be reproducible in packed columns has been described. Limiting velocities, holdup, and pressure drop at flooding have been experimentally determined for binary liquid systems in a countercurrent extraction column packed with raschig rings, Berl saddles, Lessing rings, and spheres. Generalized correlations have been suggested, with the experimental data taken into account along with, published data of other workers for the estimation of limiting velocities, holdup, and pressure drop at flooding.},

abstract = {Abstract
Countercurrent flow of liquids in columns packed with Raschig rings was studied with fluids having a wide range of physical properties. These results, along with data reported previously from other studies, were used to develop a correlation for predicting flooding rates in packed columns that is significantly better than previous correlations. Dispersed phase holdup in packed columns can be estimated over a wide range of flow rates or flow ratio by assuming a constant slip velocity between the two phases which is dependent on the properties of the fluids and packing used. Although the slip velocity is thus essentially constant at flow rates below flooding, the flooding rate correlation indicates that this term is not necessarily constant at flooding conditions.},

Of great value to design and operations engineers, it gives practical process and equipment design descriptions, basic data, plant performance results, and other detailed information on gas purification processes and hardware. This latest edition incorporates all significant advances in the field since 1985.You will find major new chapters on the rapidly expanding technologies of nitrogen oxide control, with discussions of regulatory requirements and available processes; absorption in physical solvents, covering single component and mixed solvent systems; and membrane permeation, with emphasis on the gas purification applications of membrane units. In addition, new sections cover areas of strong current interest, particularly liquid hydrocarbon treating, Claus plant tail gas treating, thermal oxidation of volatile organic compounds, and sulfur scavenging processes.This volume brings you expanded coverage of alkanolamines for hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide removal, the removal and use of ammonia in gas purification, the use of alkaline salt solutions for acid gas removal, and the use of water to absorb gas impurities. The basic technologies and all significant advances in the following areas are thoroughly described: sulfur dioxide removal and recovery processes, processes for converting hydrogen sulfide to sulfur, liquid phase oxidation processes for hydrogen sulfide removal, the absorption of water vapor by dehydrating solutions, gas dehydration and purification by adsorption, and the catalytic and thermal conversion of gas impurities.},

abstract = {{MEROX} process is used for oxidation of mercaptans to disulfide from oil cuts using air in the presence of alkaline solution and {MEROX} catalyst. In this paper, the kinetic of conversion existing mercaptans in kerosene is studied for better understanding of {MEROX} process. Impregnated activated carbon with powder of {MEROX} catalyst was analyzed in laboratory scale. The results indicate that in laboratory scale, because of pore diffusion resistance, the impregnation efficiency is low. Also, optimum conditions for mercaptan extraction by using of soda solution obtained. Meanwhile the kinetic of oxidation reaction is considered in the presence of {MEROX} catalyst and activated carbon and also, impregnated activated carbon with {MEROX} catalyst.The results, indicate for mercaptan decreasing, in similar conditions the efficiency of Impregnated activated carbon with {MEROX} is better than other catalysts.Also, the kinetic model related to catalytic reaction for mercaptan conversion to disulfide in the presence of impregnated activated carbon with {MEROX} catalyst, is represented.},

abstract = {With the recent progress made in wearable electronics, devices now require high flexibility and stretchability up to large strain levels (typically larger than 30 \% strain). Wearable strain sensors or deformable strain sensors have been gaining increasing research interest because of the rapid development of electronic skins and robotics and because of their biomedical applications. Conventional brittle strain sensors made of metals and piezoresistors are not applicable for such stretchable sensors. This Review summarizes recent advances in stretchable sensors and focuses on material aspects for high stretchability and sensitivity. It begins with a brief introduction to the Wheatstone bridge circuit of conventional resistive strain sensors. Then, studies on the manipulation of materials are reviewed, including waved structural approaches for making metals and semiconductors stretchable, the use of liquid metals, and conductive filler/elastomer composites by using percolation among the fillers. For capacitive strain sensors, the constant conductivity of the electrode is a key factor in obtaining reliable sensors. Possible approaches to developing capacitive strain sensors are presented. This Review concludes with a discussion on the major challenges and perspectives related to stretchable strain sensors.},
